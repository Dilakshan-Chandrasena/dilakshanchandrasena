                In 13 years of my schooling life, I did not learn anything related to the IT study area. In fact, stepping into the IT field was an unexpected thing in my life. My interest for learning IT started brewing in late 2019 after I found out how people achieved success in this field. Then, soon as I finished my advanced level examination, I started to learn Python language by watching YouTube tutorials from a channel called “Telusko”. I found it more interesting and fun than I ever thought and that made me realized that this is what I want to do in my life. <br><br>

                In mid-2021 I found out a super beneficial scholarship called “Infoschol” offered by Informatics Institute Technology. I applied for that and got selected to follow their 3 months induction program. In fact, I’m still following this induction program. There I got the chance to learn Python, web development, Java objected oriented programming concepts, project management concepts, basic quality assurance concepts and database concepts.  It was quite informative and handful program.

                At the beginning of this program, I was little bit afraid because I thought my less exposure to IT related stuff will affect badly for my studies. I had this thought of “will I be able to pull things off” in my mind. Turns out, I’m a quick learner. Learning Python was not that hard because I already started learning it before joining IIT. I got the chance to polish my Python skills from the induction program. <br><br>


                When it comes to web development, it was a huge challenge because I didn’t even know how to spell web development. I learned so many unfamiliar words in the web development module. In the first lecture of web development, I was really lost. Did not understand anything and that was where I realized I have to do some homework and digging before going to the lecture. SELF STUDYING. I started watching some tutorials about HTML and CSS and was able to design my first web page. It was a webpage of a restaurant called “Adere”. I felt like I have become a front-end developer after creating that. In the second lecture thing were started make sense because I did my homework. I have gained knowledge of HTML and CSS for a certain level. Now, I’m facing another challenge call learning JavaScript. Does not matter how much I try to learn JS, it’s still not familiar to me. That’s why I’m using less JS to build this portfolio website of mine. Even though, it’s kind of hard for me to learn JS, I’m enjoying trying to learn JS. Also, I learned about react.js, APIs and etc. What I have realized in this web development module is that it’s a very large and interesting study field where you have to do lot more self-studying while getting the help of your lecturer. I’m glad that I’m currently have it all with me. <br> <br> <br>

                As I mentioned in the beginning, I had to learn Java and OOP concepts in those 3 months. I didn’t have any idea about Java too at the beginning. So, I had the same thoughts which I had about in the web development module. I found Java as a language that has syntax which kind of hard to understand. Python syntax was much easier than Java. But learning Java is fun because since it has syntaxes that are hard to understand, the satisfaction of understand single thing of Java is higher than understanding things in other modules. I know it’s weird to feel like. I had to develop an inventory management program using Java, JavaFX and MongoDB which was really challenging for all the students. At the same time, it was a good experience for me because I have to work for company in near future. <br> <br>


                Also, I learned basic concepts of quality assurance. It was fun to learn QA. I learned principles of testing, methodologies, test levels, type of testing and test automation. In test automation I had to learn Selenium. Basically, Java Selenium. Also, I had to do a coursework which I had to test a website. I made a test plan and wrote the test scripts for that. <br> <br>


                In the product management module, we learned concepts about managing projects and we did a group project where we have to complete an actual project developing a prototype for that project. Our group did a project called “Save Me” which can use to alert the hospitals and the police stations in an emergency situation. We developed a website and a mobile application. We used HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and Wamp server to build our website and we used Flutter to build the mobile application. It was not only about developing but also about managing a project. I gained lot of things from that module.
                Database module also was quite challenging to learn than I thought. There were lot of concepts us to learn. We also learned MySQL. We also developed a database for a college management system. <br><br>


                At the end, learning IT modules was way interesting than I thought and I’m glad that I took this path. Finally, what I have to say from the experience that I have gained from this induction program for a student who is starting to learn IT from scratch is you have to do lot more self-studying. Not everything is going to spoon feed us. Fun fact, to learn IT related stuff your googling skills have to be exceptional.
